# Drug-Consumption-Analysis-

The data set that I used consists of 1885 respondents and for each individual, we have collected scores based on their personality measurements. The individual levels of consumption of some drugs like Coke, Heroin, Amphet, Benzos are taken. We have classified individual consumption levels as Never Used, Used over a decade ago, Used in the last decade, Used in last year, Used in last month, Used in last week, Used in last day. In order to determine the consumption levels, I have used two classification algorithms namely Naïve Bayes Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM)

DRUG use is the major threat that hinders the growth of our country. Drug consumption effects the health of a person. A person’s personality profile can be used to determine whether
he can be a drug user on not. Personality measurements are Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness
Personality measurements are as follows:
1. Neuroticism: It is a tendency to express negative emotions such as anxiety and tension.
2. Extraversion: They enjoy human interaction such as talkative and taking words of other people in a positive manner.
3. Openness to Experience: It is like appreciating some others art.
4. Agreeableness: It is a measure of interpersonal conduct such as trust and kindness.
5. Conscientiousness: It is also a tendency to be organized and strong willed.

So in order to determine the consumption level of an individual based on their personality scores we have used four machine learning classification techniques.
