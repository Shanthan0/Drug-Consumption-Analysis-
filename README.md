# Drug-Consumption-Analysis-

DRUG use is the major threat that hinders the growth of our country. Drug consumption effects the health of a person. A personâ€™s personality profile can be used to determine whether
he can be a drug user on not. Personality measurements are Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness
Personality measurements are as follows:
1. Neuroticism: It is a tendency to express negative emotions such as anxiety and tension.
2. Extraversion: They enjoy human interaction such as talkative and taking words of other people in a positive manner.
3. Openness to Experience: It is like appreciating some others art.
4. Agreeableness: It is a measure of interpersonal conduct such as trust and kindness.
5. Conscientiousness: It is also a tendency to be organized and strong willed.

So in order to determine the consumption level of an individual based on their personality scores we have used four machine learning classification techniques.
